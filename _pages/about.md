I am an AI engineer specializing in large language model pretraining at a technology company. Before starting my professional career, I got my Master's degaree from Peking University in 2023 and Bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2020. 

In the past two years, I have dedicated to develop trustyworthy conversational models through proving language understanding and reasoning, enhancing interactivity, and verifying the trustworthiness of AI-generated responses.  I am also deeply interested in the intersection of AI and social science. As trustworthy conversation AI models gain enough ability to be regarded as effective AI Agents, they will increasingly integrate into human society. To ensure seamless integration, it will be crucial to understand their interactions with humans and other AI agents.

In the long term, I aim to contribute to research that ensures AI technology is developed with safety, fairness, and ethical considerations at its core. While AI has the potential to transform society in positive ways—such as by improving daily life through intelligent automation—it also presents risks, including misinformation, fraud, and privacy concerns. I hope to conduct projects that address these risks and help shape the future of AI in a way that benefits society.

I am currently in the process of ***applying for a PhD program***, aiming to further my academic and research pursuits in developing ethical, transparent, and effective AI solutions that address complex global challenges.
